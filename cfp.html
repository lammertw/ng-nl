NG-NL is the first AngularJS conference in The Netherlands, to be held on the 13th of February 2015 in Amsterdam. The deadline for submissions is the 19th of December 2014. </p><p> The audience of the conference is of course web developers, especially AngularJS developers. We’re looking for awesome speakers who either have a unique experience to share, made a great open source tool or have something else really cool to talk about. Of course it should be somehow related to AngularJS or interesting to web developers. </p><p> Reimbursements We will cover the travel costs and hotel stay in Amsterdam for international speakers. Of course you will also receive a free conference pass if your topic is chosen. As an extra benefit we will organise a free dinner with all the speakers. </p><p> Submission You can submit your CFP proposal using the submission form below. Keep in mind that all talks should be in English. Tell us what makes your talk unique and awesome, but keep it short and to the point. </p><p> </p><p> For more information you can contact us at <a href="mailto:ng-nl@xebia.com">ng-nl@xebia.com</a>.
