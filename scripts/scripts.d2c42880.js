The data source is a graph database. The visuals are rendered using OpenLayers."},MauriceDB:{title:"Event-Sourcing your AngularJS applications","abstract":"Most AngularJS applications just store the data being edited as is in a database. While it is perfectly fine to treat data in a simple CRUD fashion like this with a smaller application this is not very optimal when applications get more complex. For more complex applications using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) design pattern together with Event-Sourcing (ES) is a much more powerful solution. With Event-Sourcing every action leading up to the current state is stored as a separate domain event. This collection of domain events is then used as the write model in the CQRS model. These same events are projected out to a secondary database to build the read model for the application. In this session Maurice de Beijer will explain why you might want to use Event-Sourcing and how to get started with this design in your AngularJS applications."},dmarjenburgh:{title:"Visual Review - Automated visual browser GUI testing for Angular projects","abstract":"When developing a web application, managing differences across many browsers and devices can be a pain. Dealing with variations in page rendering results is particularly difficult as these are hard to detect automatically. This results in lots of manual testing or, even worse, customers reporting issues on production. Both scenarios are costly. Visual Review is a new open source project from Xebia which is aimed at fixing this problem. Visual Review allows you to automatically analyze the differences between different versions of a web page and review them easily via a web-frontend. Having such a tool allows a team to greatly speed-up the web-development release cycle and increase the overall quality. What sets apart Visual Review from other open source tools in this area is a focus on a smooth development workflow. Tests are created using well known tools such as Selenium and Protractor. We aim to make managing test results as easy as possible, only asking users to review the tests that generated an unexpected output. We're also working to integrate with various other tools such as JUnit, Jenkins, GitHub and Stash. Visual Review is still a work in progress. During the workshop we'll show a demo of it's current status and explain how it works. We will show how to set it up, how to use it in a simple AngularJS project that is using Protractor for E2E tests and how you can contribute."},pkozlowski_os:{title:"Going global with AngularJS applications","abstract":"Many developers are working on web applications for the international audience. In such applications there are many details to be taken care of: translations, data formatting, handling input in different locales etc. As of today AngularJS has some supporting mechanism for writing truly global applications but the situation should dramatically improve in AngularJS 1.4 where a new translation service is worked on. This talk will walk you through i18n and i10n support available in AngularJS 1.3 as well as upcoming changes in 1.4 so you can confidently work on your applications that target global audience."},ManfredSteyer:{title:"Modern authentication solutions","abstract":"Nowadays every internet user has numerous passwords for different internet applications. The popular OAuth 2.0 protocol, supported by huge companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, promises to remedy this. This session shows what is behind OAuth 2.0, for which scenarios it is actually intended, where the dangers and challenges lie, and what OpenID Connect has to do with it. It also demonstrates how the standards mentioned can be applied together with AngularJS and UI Router, and the pitfalls of doing so."},PascalPrecht:{title:"The best Angular yet!","abstract":"With all the buzz around Angular 2.0 it may be easy to believe that the development of Angular 1.x went already stale. Fortunately this couldn’t be more wrong. The recent release of Angular 1.3 brought a whole set of great improvements, fixes and features. While some of them have already been spread in the internet, there's still a lot of stuff that seems to be overlooked. In this talk Pascal and Christoph will shed some light on the most important changes that happened since then. If you're still not convinced upgrading to the latest version, this talk is for you!"},kentcdodds:{title:"JSON Powered Forms","abstract":"We're all really tired of writing the same code for every form. You need a label here and an input here and make sure their IDs are the same and unique and now you want me to add validation!? Daah! I got fed up with this pretty quick and found that I enjoy writing JavaScript a lot more than repeating myself with HTML. If you're like me, then you'll love angular-formly. In this talk, we'll see how you can very easily represent your model with a form using a few lines of JavaScript. You want validation, conditional fields, or custom templates? You need to react to changes to a field? Piece of cake. So come on, and let's make fields less painful and more delightful."},cburgdorf:{title:"AngularJS Lab","abstract":"Join us in the AngularJS Lab if you have any questions about or problems with your AngularJS code.

This talk will have 3 main ideas that I would like to pass to the participants. 1. Client side TDD (focus on angular) is possible 2. Client side TDD is easy once u get the gist of it 3. You should practice TDD I will give a very short intro about what is TDD and why it is good for us then the rest of the talk will be a hands on workshop (coded by me) I will code a mobile ready hangman game"},teropa:{title:"Inside The Angular Directive Compiler","abstract":"Directives are Angular's most powerful feature. They are what makes Angular Angular. However, directives can also be frustratingly difficult to grasp: The API for making directives is large and convoluted - as Miško Hevery has attested. With all the configuration options, terminology, and functions-returning-functions, it buries the simple core ideas under heaps of complexity. The thing is, at the core of the directive system there is a simple process of compiling DOM nodes and linking them with Scope objects. When you understand how this process works, everything about directives becomes easier to think about. In this talk I'll build up a version of the Angular directive system that illustrates the core concepts. This will illuminate some of the dark corners of the Angular directive implementation, and give you a solid mental model of what Angular actually does with directives. This will make directives a lot less daunting as you use them in day-to-day work."},g33konaut:{title:"Going hybrid with Angular, Ionic and Phonegap","abstract":"In this talk we will cover the why, what and how of hybrid mobile applications. Starting with why a hybrid approach is a good choice for a range of scenarios (though it's obviously no silver bullet) we will then take a look at a bunch of options to take the mobile web into the app stores and leveraging native features. Then we will see a live demonstration of building an app with Angular.js, Ionic Framework and Phonegap - and deploy this to a phone. All within a few minutes. The talk will conclude with a quick run through common roadblocks and misconceptions."},ghengeveld:{title:"Domain Model Objects in AngularJS","abstract":"Although AngularJS is advertised as an MVC framework, it does not encourage or provide a standardized way to build real model objects. Gert will explain the difference between the Angular $scope object and rich model objects. He'll also demonstrate a way to simplify controllers and services by extracting logic away into JavaScript classes."},djsmith42:{title:"How I made a mess of my Angular application","abstract":"At my company, we started using Angular in 2012.

When we do a request we expect our response, and if we don't get one we're pretty lost. First we will let our user wait with a fancy animated-loading-indicator.gif, until we time out. Then, if we are really dedicated, we send the user an error message. Just maybe, we'll even log it. Then we leave it up to the user to deal with it. But is that always convenient? Why do we bug the user with this situation? Why let them wait? Let me tell you something: you don't always have to! We're going to talk about the characteristics of reactive backends, and how we can write awesome front-end software to provide the users a 'reactive experience'."}};a("#abstractModal").on("show.bs.modal",function(c){var d=a(c.relatedTarget),e=b[d.data("talk")];a(this).find(".modal-title").text(e.title),a(this).find(".modal-body").text(e["abstract"])})}(window.jQuery);
